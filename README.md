# Ã‰cole 42 - Arkanoid

### Overview
Arkanoid is a shcool project. The goal is to create an Arkanoid like with OpenGL (with GLFW) in a weekend. This was our first time with OpenGL.

Implemented features : 
* Menu with level selection
* Blocks that need multiple hits to break
* Unbreakable blocks
* Bonuses :
	* Magnet
	* Multiball
	* Life up
	* Large bar
	* "Hard" ball (goes through blocks)
